Description: Provides functions to convert origin-destination data,
    represented as straight 'desire lines' in the 'sf' Simple Features
    class system, into JSON files that can be directly imported into
    A/B Street <https://www.abstreet.org>, a free and open source tool
    for simulating urban transport systems and scenarios of change
